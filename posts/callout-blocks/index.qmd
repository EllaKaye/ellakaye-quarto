Here are my tests of callout blocks.

See the [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).

:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
Don't do that! simple appearance.
:::

:::{.callout-important}
Do do this!
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.
:::

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
Don't do that! simple appearance.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="minimal"}
Don't do that! minimal appearance.
