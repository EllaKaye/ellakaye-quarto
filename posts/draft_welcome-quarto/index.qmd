<!--------------- post content ----------------->

Hello, and welcome to my new site, built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org){target="_blank"}. Hereâ€™s why I switched from {distill}, and the resources and inspirations that helped me in the process.

## Why Quarto?

It doesn't seem all that long ago that I built a website using {distill} and announced it in a [post](../2021-05-08_welcome-distill/index.qmd) that this post will rather echo.

I was very happy with that site. Then Quarto was released and it quickly became clear that everything that I loved about working with {distill} was true of Quarto, and then some. As a keen user of a whole suite of packages in the R Markdown ecosystem, I could see the appeal of one consistent, coherent system to produce reports, presentations, books and websites. Moreover, Quarto brings with it a vast range of improvements on R Markdown, building on what RStudio/Posit learnt over a decade of developing the latter. When it was made clear that although Posit will maintain {distill}, all future improvements will be to Quarto, I knew it was only a matter of time before I rewrote my website once again, so thought I may as well get on with it.

I'm finding working with Quarto to be an absolute joy!

## Resources

This post is not a guide on how to get a Quarto website up and running. There are already great resources for that. In particular, these are the resources that I found most helpful.

### The basics

- The official Quarto [tutorials](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target="_blank"} got me started.

- The official Quarto [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/){target="_blank"} is an absolute treasure trove. I think I may well have most of the section on [websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) memorised at this point!

<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r appendix}
#| echo: false

source("../../R/appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk", 
  name = long_slug
)
```

##### Session info {.appendix}

<details><summary>Toggle</summary>

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(sessioninfo)
# save the session info as an object
pkg_session <- session_info(pkgs = "attached")

# get the quarto version
quarto_version <- system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE)

# inject the quarto info
pkg_session$platform$quarto <- paste(
  system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE), 
  "@", 
  quarto::quarto_path()
  )

# print it out
pkg_session
```
