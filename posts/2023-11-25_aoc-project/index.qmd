title: An Advent of Code website, website template and package
description: |
  I made project/website to work through then share my Advent of Code solutions, with R functions to ease the process, and I was so pleased with it that I made them into a template and package so others can use them too!

## A new website

Back in 2020, I worked through some [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges 
and wrote my solutions in [one long post](../2020-12-09_advent-of-code-2020/index.qmd).
As I added to it daily, the post became increasingly unwieldy.
Therefore, as I prepared to participate in Advent of Code 2023, 
I decided to build a separate website which would be simultaneously
a project in which to work on the puzzles, and also a blog 
from which to publish my solutions. 
The idea is to have a separate listing page for each year, 
and a separate post for each day.
The inspiration came from Emil Hvitfeldt's [R Advent of Code](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/rstats-adventofcode/) site.

This is easy to implement in [Quarto](https://quarto.org) 
and I quickly got a new site up and running, copying over my 2020 solutions, and working on some from 2022 while I was at it.

My Advent of Code website is now live and ready for 2023, 
at <https://adventofcode.ellakaye.co.uk>.


<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->

```{r appendix}
#| echo: false

source("../../R/appendix.R")
insert_appendix(
  repo_spec = "EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk", 
  name = long_slug
)
```

##### Session info {.appendix}

<details><summary>Toggle</summary>

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(sessioninfo)
# save the session info as an object
pkg_session <- session_info(pkgs = "attached")

# get the quarto version
quarto_version <- system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE)

# inject the quarto info
pkg_session$platform$quarto <- paste(
  system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE), 
  "@", 
  quarto::quarto_path()
  )

# print it out
pkg_session
```

</details>
