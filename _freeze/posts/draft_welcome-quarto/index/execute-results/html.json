Here’s why I switched from {distill}, and the resources and inspirations that helped me in the process.\n\n## Why Quarto?\n\nIt doesn't seem all that long ago that I built a website using {distill} and announced it in a [post](../2021-05-08_welcome-distill/index.qmd) that this post will rather echo.\n\nI was very happy with that site. Then Quarto was released and it quickly became clear that everything that I loved about working with {distill} was true of Quarto, and then some. As a keen user of a whole suite of packages in the R Markdown ecosystem, I could see the appeal of one consistent, coherent system to produce reports, presentations, books and websites. Moreover, Quarto brings with it a vast range of improvements on R Markdown, building on what RStudio/Posit learnt over a decade of developing the latter. When it was made clear that although Posit will maintain {distill}, all future improvements will be to Quarto, I knew it was only a matter of time before I rewrote my website once again, so thought I may as well get on with it.\n\nI'm finding working with Quarto to be an absolute joy!\n\n## Resources\n\nThis post is not a guide on how to get a Quarto website up and running. There are already great resources for that. In particular, these are the resources that I found most helpful.\n\n### The basics\n\n- The official Quarto [tutorials](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target=\"_blank\"} got me started.\n\n- The official Quarto [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/){target=\"_blank\"} is an absolute treasure trove. I think I may well have most of the section on [websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) memorised at this point!\n\n- djnavarro/nick tierney.\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n## Last updated {.appendix}\n \n2022-12-02 22:17:48 GMT\n \n## Details {.appendix}\n \n[source code](https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk/tree/main/posts/draft_welcome-quarto/index.qmd){target='_blank'}, [R environment](https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk/tree/main/posts/draft_welcome-quarto/renv.lock){target='_blank'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Session info {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Toggle</summary>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)\n os       macOS Monterey 12.6.1\n system   aarch64, darwin20\n ui       X11\n language (EN)\n collate  en_US.UTF-8\n ctype    en_US.UTF-8\n tz       Europe/London\n date     2022-12-02\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n quarto   1.2.247 @ /usr/local/bin/quarto\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n ! package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n P sessioninfo * 1.2.2   2021-12-06 [?] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n\n [1] /Users/ellakaye/Rprojs/mine/ellakaye-quarto/renv/library/R-4.2/aarch64-apple-darwin20\n [2] /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/library\n\n P ── Loaded and on-disk path mismatch.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n\n",
